- Smart Data Integration (SDI)

For a full list see http://news.sap.com/germany/files/2017/01/SAP-HANA-Express-Edition-FAQ-extern.pdf[the HANA Express FAQ]

For this quickstart guide you need to download the Binary installer method as described in detail on this page: https://www.sap.com/developer/tutorials/hxe-ua-installing-binary.html

As the SAP tutorial only describes the graphical interface which is not feasible for the training server in the cloud, you need to do the following

=== Update the ansible environment

In the previous part training you have learned how to create basic playbooks, setup an inventory file and start. Update your environment like this:

1. Make sure your inventory file is used by default when executing commands from the `~/ansible-files/` directory.
On tower-GUID as ansible create the file `~/ansible-files/ansible.cfg` with the following content:
+
----
[defaults]
inventory=/home/ansible/ansible-files/inventory
----
2. Create an inventory file with one hana host in this directory
+
----
$ rm ~ansible/ansible-files/inventory
$ echo "[hana]" > ~ansible/ansible-files/inventory
$ echo "hana1.example.com" >> ~ansible/ansible-files/inventory
----

3. remove existing files in the subdirectory `group_vars` and `host_vars`
+
----
$ rm /home/ansible/ansible-files/group_vars/*
$ rm /home/ansible/ansible-files/host_vars/*
----

4. Test with an ad-hoc command that the ansible connection is working:
+
----
[ansible@tower-GUID ~]$ ansible -m ping hana1.example.com
hana1.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
----
