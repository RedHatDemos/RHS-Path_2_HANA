## Prepare Access to Lab environment

Before you provision your lab environment you want to make sure that you can connect to your servers after the provisioning. This can be achieved via ssh public-keys or kerberos.

### Setup SSH
To access the jumphost via SSH, use your personal OPENTLC SSO username and public SSH key.

NOTE: Unless otherwise noted, you cannot use SSH to connect directly as root.

If you have not already done so, you must provide a public SSH key.

 . Go to https://www.opentlc.com/update and log in.
 . Paste your public key in the appropriate field.

TIP: For more information on generating an SSH key, see: https://www.opentlc.com/ssh.html[Setting Up an SSH Key Pair].

### Use Kerberos Authentication Instead of SSH Keys (Advanced)
If you have problems using SSH keys, use Kerberos authentication instead. To do this you must be running on a UNIX/Linux or macOS host.

NOTE: Windows hosts can support Kerberos, but it is beyond the scope of this class to provide instructions for implementing it.

1. Make sure you have the following settings in `/etc/krb5.conf` on your host (not in the lab environment):

  dns_lookup_realm = true
  dns_lookup_kdc = true

2. Use the following command to obtain a Kerberos ticket:

   $ kinit your-sso-login@OPENTLC.COM
   <enter your OPENTLC SSO password>

IMPORTANT: Capitalize all letters of OPENTLC.COM, as shown.
